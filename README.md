# MCDLink (Minecraft-Discord Link)
A bridge between Minecraft servers and Discord servers, allowing players to self-whitelist through Discord.

## NOTICE
This is very much a work-in-progress, and I cannot guarantee this will ever be finished.
As of right now MCDLink is a bit buggy and has a lot of missing features.
